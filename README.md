# bombGame
This game may be considered as a time killer. 
# Interface
At the top you can see FUSE label, which shows how many fuse you have and basically how many time you can play. The next label says POINTS, which means the number of the points that you have scored. 
In the centre you see the picture of the bomb itself, which will change throughout the game. 
# Instructions
So, what you have to do is to PRESS ENTER to start the game. You should see that the fuse is decreasing, then you have to PRESS SPACEBAR, which increases your fuse number. The more you press spacebar, the more fuse you have. 
The more fuse you have - the highest score you get. 

The second you have 0 fuse left, the game is over. 
So now you can see the 'SAVE SCORE' button on the right, which basically saves your score to the database. 
To check your progress, see the button 'YOUR HISTORY', where you can see the number of times you played, your score, date and time of the last time of playing. 

That is pretty it, hope you'll enjoy it.
